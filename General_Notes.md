# Notes

## for any reason c# not complier project

```text
When you try to use Go To Definition, you will
sometimes see an error saying No definition found. This is because
the C# extension does not know about the current project. Navigate
to View | Command Palette, enter and select OmniSharp: Select
Project, and then select the correct project that you want to work with.
